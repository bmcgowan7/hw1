  <h1> Here is how it works!</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Category 1: Team Breaks<li>
        <p class='faqp'>In a team break, the breaker will list all teams that are included in the checklist for that set of cards.  The teams are auctioned and after that, the breaker will video take them opening up the cards, typically on YouTube.  You win the item that is gaurenteed to you and... all of the cards that are in that break for the team you win are yours.</p>
      <li>Category 2: Player Breaks<li>
        <p class='faqp'> In a player break, the breaker will list all players that are included in the checklist for that set of cards.  The players are auctioned and after that, the breaker will video take them opening up the cards, typically on YouTube.  You win the item that is gaurenteed to you and... all of the cards that are in that break for the player you win are yours.</p>
      <li>Category 3: Random Breaks<li>
        <p class='faqp'>In a random break, the breaker will set a fixed price, or will auction off a non descript but numbers spots that cover all teams that are included in the checklist for that set of cards.  During the break, the breaker will determine who wins the team via a ranomization meathod, such as rolling die or using random.org.  After that, the breaker will video take them opening up the cards, typically on YouTube.  You win the item that is gaurenteed to you and... all of the cards that are in that break for the team or player you win are yours.</p>
