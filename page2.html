  <h1> Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>"Is this a chance break site?"<li>
        <p class='faqp'>No!  That would be gambling. This is not a gambling site.  It is for collectors.  Whether you recieve a single baseball card, a hand written note, a paperclip or an empty envelope, you are paying for the item listed in the description of some sort.</p>
      <li>"Other auction sites charges so much more, how do you keep your prices low?"<li>
        <p class='faqp'> This is a community. As as a member of this community, you are expected to develop a reputation and be a good citizen. Othersites provide extensive services to audit and managers customer and seller claims.  We do not.</p>
      <li>"So what happens if I have a claim?"<li>
        <p class='faqp'>It is simple, there is only one type of claim.  That you engaged in a transaction and it did not take place.  Either you didn't recieve the item, the payment, follow the appropriate rules, or the product was damaged upon arrival.  In this community, the seller is responsible for the item through delivery.  There are no rules on how to resolve disputes.
        Therefore, it is up to you.  You get three claims in 6 months.  The seller or buyer fills out the claim form, submits it via email an copies the other party.  The second party responds with a rebuttal form.  We will not reach out to you to remind you to respond.  Your notification is the original claim submission.  The rebuttal must be recieved within 14 calendar days.  All information on the form is final.
      The commisioner will review both documents and make a final decision.  The losing party recievess a strike.  After 3 strikes... you are out for 12 months.  Simple, easy, effective. </p>
      <li>"Can I file an appeal?"<li>
        <p class= 'faqp'>Nope.  This increases costs and the commisioners word is final and binding.  So... Don't get into this mess in the first place.  Be reasonable and work it out.</p>
      <li>"So, what are your responsibilities here?"<li>
        <p class= 'faqp'>None. Even the commissioner piece.  This site is a completely at will marketplace.  It is buyer beware and reputation matters.  You should not expect anything other than that we have a website.  This includes the website going offline.</p>
